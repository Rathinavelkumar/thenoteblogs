# The Silver Bell

During the first snowfall, a magical silver bell appeared in the village square. Whoever rang it with a pure wish would see their dream come true.

A boy named **Finn** wished for his family to be happy and healthy. The bell chimed, and warmth filled every home in the village.

> **Moral of the story:** Selfless wishes bring joy to all.
