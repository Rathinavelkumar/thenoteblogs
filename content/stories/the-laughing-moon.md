# The Laughing Moon

Every night, the moon watched over the village and giggled at the children’s games. One cloudy evening, the children sang a song to cheer up the hidden moon. The clouds parted, and the moon’s laughter filled the sky with twinkling stars.

> **Moral of the story:** Sharing joy brings light to everyone around you.
