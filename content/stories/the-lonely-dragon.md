# The Lonely Dragon

In the shadow of the Misty Mountains lived a gentle dragon named **Dara**. Dara had shimmering green scales and a heart full of dreams, but the villagers feared her and stayed far away.

One day, Dara watched from her hilltop as children played in the fields. She longed to join them but worried she would frighten them. Instead, she used her fiery breath to light lanterns for the village every night, hoping to show her kindness.

When a fierce storm struck and the village was in darkness, the children noticed the glowing lanterns and followed their light to Dara’s hill. There, they found the dragon waiting with a warm, gentle smile.

The children realized Dara was not scary, but friendly and helpful. They invited her to play, and soon the whole village learned to love their gentle dragon.

> **Moral of the story:** Don’t judge others by their appearance; true kindness shines from within.
