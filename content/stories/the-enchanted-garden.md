# The Enchanted Garden

Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, lived a kind-hearted girl named **Ella**. Ella loved flowers, and her small garden was the pride of the village. One evening, while tending to her roses, she discovered a tiny, glowing *key* buried in the soil. Curiosity sparkled in her eyes as she wondered where the *magical key* might lead.

The next morning, Ella followed a trail of shimmering petals that appeared outside her garden. The trail led her deep into the forest, where she discovered an ancient, ivy-covered door hidden within a tree. With trembling hands, she used the *magical key* to unlock the door, and it creaked open to reveal a breathtaking, enchanted garden.

The garden was alive with colors and wonders she had never seen before—flowers that glowed in the dark, trees that whispered secrets, and a sparkling *fountain of dreams*. But the garden’s beauty came with a secret: it was guarded by a gentle **griffin** named **Azor**. Azor explained that the garden would grant Ella one wish if she promised to care for it and protect its magic.

Ella thought deeply and made her wish—not for wealth or power, but for her village to be forever bountiful and happy. The garden glowed brightly, and from that day on, the village flourished. Crops grew abundantly, flowers bloomed year-round, and joy filled the hearts of everyone.

Ella returned to visit the enchanted garden often, always keeping her promise to Azor. She became known not just for her kindness but for her wisdom and selflessness.

> The moral of the story: *True happiness comes from caring for others and sharing kindness wherever you go.*
