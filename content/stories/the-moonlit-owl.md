# The Moonlit Owl

In the tallest tree of the Whispering Woods lived an owl named **Orla** who watched over the village each night. When the children had trouble sleeping, Orla would sing gentle lullabies, sending sweet dreams on the wind.

One night, a storm frightened the village animals. Orla gathered them beneath her tree and told stories of bravery and hope. The storm soon passed, and everyone felt safe and calm.

> **Moral of the story:** A gentle voice and a kind heart can bring comfort in any storm.
