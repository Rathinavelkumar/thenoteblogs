# The Glass Mountain

In a distant land stood a mountain made entirely of glass. Many tried to climb it, but only a brave goat named **Gilly** dared to reach the top. Step by careful step, Gilly climbed, helping others along the way.

When she reached the summit, the mountain glowed with rainbow colors, and everyone celebrated her courage and kindness.

> **Moral of the story:** Helping others on your journey makes every victory brighter.
