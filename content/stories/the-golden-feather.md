# The Golden Feather

On the edge of a sparkling lake, a curious duckling named **Pip** found a golden feather glinting in the reeds. When he picked it up, he felt a warm, magical energy.

Pip soon discovered that the feather could grant a single wish. Instead of wishing for endless treats, Pip wished for his friends to always be happy.

The lake sparkled brighter, and Pipâ€™s friends cheered with joy. From that day, the golden feather brought happiness to the whole pond.

> **Moral of the story:** Wishing happiness for others brings happiness to yourself.
