# The Cloud Bridge

Two best friends, **Milo** and **Tara**, dreamed of touching the sky. One magical morning, a bridge of clouds appeared, inviting them on an adventure above the world.

They helped a lost rainbow find its colors and learned that together, they could reach any dream.

> **Moral of the story:** Friendship can take you to new heights.
