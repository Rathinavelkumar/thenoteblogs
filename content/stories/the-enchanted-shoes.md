# The Enchanted Shoes

In a quiet village, a cobbler’s daughter named **Lila** discovered a pair of shoes that glowed with magical light. When she slipped them on, she could leap over rivers and dance on the clouds!

Lila used the enchanted shoes to help her neighbors—delivering bread, picking apples, and cheering up lonely friends. But she always returned the shoes to their special box, knowing that magic was meant to be shared.

> **Moral of the story:** Sharing what you have brings joy and magic to everyone.
