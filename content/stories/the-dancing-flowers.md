# The Dancing Flowers

Every spring, the flowers in Lilyâ€™s garden would dance at dawn. Lily joined them, spinning and laughing, and the garden bloomed brighter each year.

One day, she invited her friends to join, and together they made the whole village smile.

> **Moral of the story:** Joy shared with friends makes the world bloom.
