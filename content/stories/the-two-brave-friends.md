# The Two Brave Friends

Once upon a time, in a dense forest filled with tall trees and sparkling streams, lived two best friends, **Leo the lion** and **Milo the mouse**. Despite their differences, they shared a deep bond of friendship. Leo was strong and bold, while Milo was clever and quick-thinking. They complemented each other perfectly, and the other animals often admired how close they were.

One day, as they were exploring the forest together, Milo fell into a *hidden trap* set by hunters. He squeaked in panic, knowing he couldn’t escape on his own. When Leo heard Milo’s cries, he rushed to the scene and tried to help. But the trap’s ropes were too tough, even for Leo’s strong claws. Determined to save his friend, Leo decided to seek help from the other animals in the forest.

Leo gathered animals from far and wide, explaining Milo’s predicament. Together, they worked as a team: the deer pulled on the ropes, the woodpecker pecked at the knots, and even the tiny ants nibbled away at the fibers. With everyone’s help, the trap was finally broken, and Milo was free! He hugged Leo tightly, thanking him for his bravery and loyalty.

Weeks later, it was Milo’s turn to show his friendship. Leo accidentally wandered too close to the hunters’ camp, and a heavy *net* was thrown over him. The hunters thought they had caught a powerful lion. But Milo, remembering Leo’s courage, quickly ran to his aid. Using his sharp teeth and cleverness, he gnawed through the net and freed Leo, before the hunters could return.

From that day onward, their bond grew even stronger. Leo and Milo realized that true friendship is not about size or strength but about standing by each other in times of need.

> The moral of the story: *Friendship is about loyalty, teamwork, and supporting each other through thick and thin.*
