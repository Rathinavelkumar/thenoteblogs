# The Courageous Cricket

In a colorful garden, a cricket named **Cory** loved to play his violin. When a shadowy cat threatened the garden, Cory played a bold, beautiful tune that brought all the animals together. United, they kindly asked the cat to stay and play instead of scare.

The cat agreed, and soon the garden was filled with music and laughter.

> **Moral of the story:** Courage and harmony can turn fear into friendship.
