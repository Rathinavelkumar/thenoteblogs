# The Kind Wind

In a sunny valley, a cheerful girl named **Maya** loved to feel the wind in her hair. One day, she met the **Kind Wind**, who could carry wishes across the sky.

When Maya wished for her friend’s garden to bloom, the Kind Wind gently scattered seeds and rain. Soon, the valley blossomed with flowers, and everyone celebrated Maya’s thoughtful wish.

> **Moral of the story:** Thoughtful wishes and kind actions can make the world bloom.
