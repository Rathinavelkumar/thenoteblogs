# The Tiny Hero

In a grand castle lived a tiny mouse named **Max**. Though small, Max dreamed of being a hero. When the king’s crown was lost in the garden maze, Max volunteered to find it.

He squeezed through narrow paths, dodged clever traps, and finally found the crown atop a tall sunflower. With courage and cleverness, Max returned the crown to the grateful king.

From that day on, Max was known as the kingdom’s tiniest, bravest hero.

> **Moral of the story:** No act of courage is too small to make a big difference.
