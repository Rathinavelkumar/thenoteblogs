# The Wishing Well

In the heart of a sleepy village stood an old wishing well said to grant the purest wishes. Every evening, children gathered around, tossing in coins and whispering their dreams.

One night, a shy girl named **Ella** wished for a friend. The next morning, she found a puppy waiting by the well, wagging its tail. Ella and her new friend played together every day, and soon, the other children joined in, making wishes for kindness and laughter.

The wishing well glimmered brighter with each selfless wish, and the village became a place of joy and friendship.

> **Moral of the story:** True wishes come from the heart and bring happiness to all.
