# The Wind and the Willow

By the river, a willow tree and the Wind became best friends. The Wind told stories, and the willowâ€™s branches danced with delight. Together, they brought peace and music to the riverside.

> **Moral of the story:** Friendship can turn ordinary days into something special.
