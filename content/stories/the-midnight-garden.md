# The Midnight Garden

Every midnight, a secret garden in the heart of the city bloomed with glowing flowers and singing crickets. Only those with a kind heart could find its hidden gate.

One night, a boy named **Leo** stumbled upon the garden. He promised to care for its magical plants, and in return, the gardenâ€™s magic spread throughout the city, filling it with beauty and peace.

> **Moral of the story:** Caring for nature brings magic and harmony to the world.
