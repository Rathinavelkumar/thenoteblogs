# The Whispering Shell

On a quiet beach, a girl named **Sandy** found a shell that whispered secrets of the sea. She listened and learned how to help the creatures of the shore.

Sandy became the beachâ€™s greatest friend, and the ocean sang her name in every wave.

> **Moral of the story:** Listening to nature brings wisdom and friendship.
