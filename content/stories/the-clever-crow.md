# The Clever Crow

Once upon a time, in a parched village where the sun blazed down relentlessly, lived a clever crow named Coco. The streams and ponds had dried up, and the animals were desperate for water. Coco flew from one corner of the village to another, searching for even the smallest drop to quench her thirst.

After hours of searching, she spotted a pitcher sitting under a tree. But when she landed beside it, her heart sank—the pitcher contained only a small amount of water, and her beak couldn’t reach it. Coco didn’t give up. Instead, she used her clever mind to come up with a solution.

She started gathering small pebbles from nearby and dropped them one by one into the pitcher. As the pebbles settled, the water rose slowly. Coco kept at it until the water reached the brim. With a joyful caw, she took a sip and felt her thirst fade away. 

The other animals watched in awe, inspired by Coco’s ingenuity. Soon, they learned to think creatively and find solutions to their own problems.

**Moral of the story:** Never give up; use your wit and resources to overcome challenges.
