# Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little girl named **Red Riding Hood**. She always wore a bright red cloak with a hood, which made her stand out wherever she went. One sunny morning, her mother asked her to deliver a basket of treats to her grandmother, who lived deep in the woods. Before she left, her mother warned her, “Be careful and stay on the path, as the woods can be dangerous.”

With her *basket of treats* in hand, **Red Riding Hood** skipped joyfully along the winding trail. Along the way, she encountered a sly **Wolf** who asked where she was going. Innocent and trusting, she told him about her grandmother’s cottage. The **Wolf**, pretending to be friendly, suggested she pick some flowers for her grandmother. Enthralled by the idea, she wandered off the path to gather a beautiful *bouquet of flowers*.

Meanwhile, the **Wolf** raced ahead to the grandmother’s cottage, tricking his way inside. He disguised himself in a *grandmother's nightcap and spectacles*, lying in wait for **Red Riding Hood**. When she arrived and stepped inside, something felt off. “Oh, Grandmother! What big eyes you have!” she said. “All the better to see you with, my dear,” replied the **Wolf**.

But **Red Riding Hood** was clever. She noticed his big ears and sharp teeth. Realizing she was in danger, she quickly thought of a plan and screamed for help. A kind **Woodsman**, who was passing by, heard her cries and rushed to the rescue. Together, they scared the **Wolf** away and made sure Grandmother was safe.

> The moral of the story: *Always stay cautious and follow guidance, for straying off the path can lead to trouble.*
