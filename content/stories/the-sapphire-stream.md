# The Sapphire Stream

A magical stream flowed through the heart of the forest, its waters sparkling like sapphires. Animals came from far and wide to drink and share stories, learning that kindness was the source of the streamâ€™s magic.

> **Moral of the story:** Sharing brings magic and happiness to all.
