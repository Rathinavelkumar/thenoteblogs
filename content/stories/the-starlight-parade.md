# The Starlight Parade

Once a year, the stars came down to parade through the village. Children danced beneath the glowing lights, making wishes and sharing stories.

The stars promised to return as long as the village kept kindness in their hearts.

> **Moral of the story:** Kindness lights up even the darkest night.
